2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/Ethernet_to_parallel_0/U0/clock_data_latch_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/Ethernet_to_parallel_0/U0/clock_preamble_latch_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/Ethernet_to_parallel_0/U0/clock_sync_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/Ethernet_to_parallel_0/U0/clock_sync_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/Ethernet_to_parallel_0/U0/clock_sync_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/Ethernet_to_parallel_0/U0/clock_sync_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/Ethernet_to_parallel_0/U0/preamble_start_buffer_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#8 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/Ethernet_to_parallel_0/U0/preamble_start_buffer_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#9 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/Ethernet_to_parallel_0/U0/timeout_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#10 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/Ethernet_to_parallel_0/U0/timeout_reg[0]__0/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#11 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/Ethernet_to_parallel_0/U0/timeout_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#12 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/Ethernet_to_parallel_0/U0/timeout_reg[1]__0/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net RX_plus_0_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): RX_plus_0_IBUF_inst/O, design_1_i/RX_plus_0
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell design_1_i/Ethernet_to_parallel_0/U0/clock_preamble_latch_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) design_1_i/Ethernet_to_parallel_0/U0/clock_preamble_latch_reg/CLR,
design_1_i/Ethernet_to_parallel_0/U0/clock_sync_reg[0]/CLR,
design_1_i/Ethernet_to_parallel_0/U0/clock_sync_reg[1]/CLR,
design_1_i/Ethernet_to_parallel_0/U0/clock_sync_reg[2]/CLR,
design_1_i/Ethernet_to_parallel_0/U0/clock_sync_reg[3]/PRE,
design_1_i/Ethernet_to_parallel_0/U0/timeout_reg[0]__0/CLR
design_1_i/Ethernet_to_parallel_0/U0/timeout_reg[1]__0/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
